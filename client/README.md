# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


TODO remaining changes to be done-
- Improve the styling of the dashboard.
- FIX the all category fetch data. 
- Learn and Add Debouncing 


##Features Remaining:

##Best Practices:
- managing the user data into localstorage correctly .
- clearing the local storage when the tokens are expired and cleared.
- the way of checking the role of user (ADMIN,USER) is best practice or not ?
